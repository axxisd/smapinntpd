MAKECHS(1)
==========

NAME
----
makechs - A program that can be used to create additional translation tables for
          use by SmapiNNTPd.

SYNOPSIS
--------
makechs <fromchrs> <destchrs> <frommap> [<destmap>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *.chs files in the "xlat" and "unicode/xlat" directories are character set
translation tables in the GoldED+ format. The files were created from mappings
files found at this URL:

http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/

Fallback sequences for characters that do not exist in the target charset were
taken from Markus Kuhn's transliteration tables found at the URL below:

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/transtab.tar.gz

If you want to create additional translation tables, you can easily  do
so using this utility.

OPTIONS
-------
A summary of options is included below:

    <fromchrs>
        The fidonet name of the charset you want to convert from.

    <destchrs>
        The fidonet name of the charset you want to convert to.

    <frommap>
        The Unicode mappings file for the source charset.

    <destmap>
        The  Unicode  mappings  file for the destination charset. If you
        don't supply a mappings file, makechs will instead create a  chs
        file that converts the source charset to utf-8.

The  output  of makechs is written to the console and needs to be redirected to
the desired file.
