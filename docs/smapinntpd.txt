SMAPINNTPD(1)
=============

NAME
----
smapinntpd - An NNTP server that allows newsreaders to access a JAM, Squich, and
*.msg type message bases.

SYNOPSIS
--------
smapinntpd [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
SmapiNNTPd is an attempt to merge FTN/Fidonet technology with  standard
Usenet  newsreaders.  Basically, it is an NNTP server that allows news‐
readers to access a JAM messagebase.

The behaviour of SmapiNNTPd can be configured using  the  configuration
options specified below. These can be given to SmapiNNTPd in two ways:

    1) As commandline arguments

    2)  In  a  configuration file (see -config command). The preceding dash
    (-) is optional when an option is given in a file, it will be added  if
    missing.  A configuration file with the default settings can be created
    with the -create option.

If SmapiNNTPd is run without any commandline arguments at all, it  will
attempt	to  read  options  from  a  file called "smapinntpd.config" if
present. Under Linux, SmapiNNTPd  will look for this file in the "/etc"
directory and under Windows in the current directory.

It  is not necessary to specify any configuration options at all unless
when fine-tuning SmapiNNTPd, the default have been designed to be  sen‐
sible.


OPTIONS
-------
General options:

    -port <port> or -p <port>
        Set  the	port  where  SmapiNNTPd  listens  for connections. The
        default is 5000.

    -max <maxconn> or -m <maxconn>
        The maximum allowed number of  connections  at  one  time.  The
        default is 5.

    -groups <groupsfile> or -g <groupsfile>
        -allow  <allowfile>  or  -a <allowfile> -users <usersfile> or -u
        <usersfile> -xlat <xlatfile> or -x <xlatfile> Use those to over‐
        ride the default locations of the config files.

    -logfile <logfile> or -l <logfile>
        Use this to override the default location of the log file.

    -noecholog
        Disables echoing of log messages to the console window.

    -debug If  this	option	is  used,  SmapiNNTPd  will print all sent and
        received text to the console window. Useful for testing

Options for displaying messages:

    -readorigin
        Get address from the Origin line instead of the  OADDRESS  field
        of  the JAM message header. This option makes SmapiNNTPd slower,
        but may be useful if your  tosser  does  not  set  the  OADDRESS
        field.

    -noencode
        SmapiNNTPd  by default MIME-encodes headers with non-ascii char‐
        acters. If you use this option, SmapiNNTPd will instead send the
        headers as plain 8-bit text.

    -strictnetmail
        Makes  SmapiNNTPd  use  strict article counters for netmail mes‐
        sages. Normally SmapiNNTPd uses article  counters  that  include
        all  messages,  not only those that the user is allowed to read.
        That behaviour is much faster, but may cause your newsreader  to
        indicate	the  presence of new messages in the netmail area even
        when there are only messages for other users. Using this	option
        will  make  SmapiNNTPd  slower, but speed seems to be acceptable
        for small netmail areas with up to  1000	messages.  Users  will
        never  be  allowed  to  actually	read netmail messages of other
        users even when this option is not used.

    -def_flowed onoff
        -def_showto onoff Sets the default of the flowed and showto set‐
        tings  (if no default is specified on the commandline, both will
        be on by default)

        flowed: If flowed is on, SmapiNNTPd will use format=flowed (sec‐
        tion 6.5),  otherwise it will wrap long lines to a fixed width.

        showto: Since there is no receiver for news messages, SmapiNNTPd
        can display the receiver name as a part of the sender name. With
        this option, this behaviour can be turned on or off.

        These  can be modified by the user by logging in with parameters
        (section 4.4)


Options for posting messages:

    -nostripre
        SmapiNNTPd normally strips "Re:"	from  subject  lines  of  fol‐
        lowups. Use this option if you want to retain the "Re:".

    -notearline
        SmapiNNTPd  normally  puts the information from the X-Newsreader
        or User-Agent header field in the tearline of  posted  messages.
        This  option  disables  this  behaviour  and leaves the tearline
        blank.

    -noreplyaddr
        SmapiNNTPd normally adds a  REPLYADDR  kludge  with  the	e-mail
        address of the sender in posted messages. Use this option if you
        don't want REPLYADDR  kludges.  See  also  see  section  6.4  in
        ReadMe.txt.

    -notzutc
        SmapiNNTPd normally writes the timezone into a TZUTC kludge when
        a message is posted. You can use this option if you  don't  want
        to create TZUTC kludges.

    -nocancel
        Disallows the cancelling (deleting) of messages by the users. If
        allowed, users can only cancel messages from one of their "real‐
        names" and only if the message has not yet been sent.

    -smartquote
        The  quoting  style of most newsreaders is different from tradi‐
        tional fidonet software. If you enable this  option,  SmapiNNTPd
        will try to change any quoted lines to fidonet style. This means
        that it will try to insert the initials of the person you  reply
        to  before  the  '>' character and also that it will try to com‐
        pound multiple generations of quotes, i.e.  "AA>	BB>"  will  be
        changed into "BB>>".

        Reformatting  quotes in this way means that the user who posts a
        message will no longer have final say over the final content  of
        the message since it will be changed after he or she sends it to
        SmapiNNTPd. Since this in principle  is  a  bad  thing  even  if
        quoted  text  will  look	a  lot better after reformatting, this
        option is turned off by default.

    -origin <origin>
        Normally SmapiNNTPd uses the  text  found  in  the  Organization
        header  line as the Origin line text in posted messages. You can
        use this switch to override the Organization line and  set  your
        own origin for all posted messages.

    -guestsuffix <suffix>
        If  desired, SmapiNNTPd can add a suffix to posts from unauthen‐
        ticated users. To activate  that	feature,  specify  the	suffix
        here.

        Example:    -guestsuffix " [GUEST]".

    -echomailjam <echomail.jam>
        If  you specify a filename here, SmapiNNTPd will write a line to
        this file with the messagebase and message number for each  mes‐
        sage  that  is posted.  The file follows the ECHOMAIL.JAM format
        supported by some tossers.

Options for configuration files:

    -config <configfile>
        Read options from the specified configuration file.

    -create <configfile>
        Create a configuration file with the default settings.
